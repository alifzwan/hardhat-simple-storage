# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
      DESCRIPTION                                      COMMANDS
To deploy your smart contract               - yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js 
Compile you solidity file                   - yarn hardhat compile               
Delete you cache and artifacts              - yarn hardhat clean                  
Display a list of hardhat accounts          - yarn hardhat node                  
Test your Smart Contract                    - yarn hardhat test                  
REPORT_GAS=true yarn hardhat test
