# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js - To deploy your smart contract            -
yarn hardhat compile               - Compile you solidity file
yarn hardhat clean                 - Delete you cache and artifacts
yarn hardhat node                  - Display a list of hardhat accounts
yarn hardhat test                  - Test your Smart Contract
REPORT_GAS=true yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat help
```
